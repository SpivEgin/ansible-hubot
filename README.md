# Ansible Hubot

> **NOTE**: 1.3.0 default change: This role now defaults to installing a
> Slack based hubot with the `hubot_adapter` variable. Changing the variable
> value to 'hipchat' will install for HipChat instead.

This is an [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) role for
[Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/), the wonderful chatting robot that is sure
to bring your team much delight and various values of increased productivity
throughout the livelong day!

By default this Hubot role uses the Slack adapter, but that can be easily
changed to work with HipChat by editing `defaults/main.yml`, updating the
value of *hubot_adapter*, and adding the appropriate environment variables
to `templates/_hubot_{{hubot_adapter}}.env.j2`.

## Requirements

This Hubot role requires a Ubuntu or CentOS based Linux host and has been
tested to function on Ubuntu and CentOS with the following specific
software versions:

* Ansible: 1.9.4
* Hubot: GitHub Master
* Node.js: 0.10.37
* CentOS: 6
* Ubuntu: 14.04, 13.10, 13.04, 12.10, 12.04

## Works with Ansible Galaxy

This role is designed to be installed via the `ansible-galaxy` command
instead of being directly run from the git repository.

You should install it like this:

```
ansible-galaxy install brianshumate.hubot
```

You'll want to make sure you have write access to `/etc/ansible/roles/` since
that is where the role will be installed by default, or define your own
Ansible role path by creating a `$HOME/.ansible.cfg` file with these contents:

```
[defaults]
roles_path = <path_to_your_preferred_role_location>
```

Change `<path_to_your_preferred_role_location>` to a directory you have write
access to.

See the [ansible-galaxy](http://docs.ansible.com/galaxy.html) documentation
for more details.

## Role Variables

All role variables should be in `defaults/main.yml`.

| epel_package  | `epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm` | EPEL reposiory package file name |
| epel_url      | "http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm" | EPEL repository URL |
| hubot_ubuntu_os_packages | List | List of Ubuntu specific OS packages to install
| hubot_centos_os_packages | List | List of CentOS specific OS packages to install
|hubot_custom_scripts | List | A list of additional Hubot scripts to use

## Node Packages

The `hubot_node_packages` defines the following Node.js dependency packages:

* cheerio
* clark
* cleverbot-node
* htmlparser
* hubot-calculator
* hubot-hipchat-emoticons
* nodepie
* soupselect

The `hubot_centos_os_packages` and `hubot_ubuntu_os_packages` variables
define OS packages required by Hubot; they should be fine as-is.

The `hubot_os_packages` defines following OS dependency packages:

* build-essential
* curl
* git-core
* libssl-dev
* libexpat1-dev
* redis-server

Most of these packages are required with the exception of `redis-server`,
which is a dependency of the Hubot `redis-brain` script.

### Scripts

You can enable Hubot scripts by uncommenting or adding them to
the `hubot_scripts` variable.

The project includes a reasonable set of custom scripts befitting something
akin to an engineering team, but if you prefer, you can replace them with
your own list of scripts.

The optional commented out scripts in `defaults/main.yml`:

* github-status.coffee
* wunderground.coffee

You will need to uncomment the appropriate variables in `defaults/main.yml`
to make use of these scripts and add your own.

If you add more custom scripts be sure to add any Node.js dependencies
required by the scripts to the `hubot_node_packages` variable list as well.

## Configuration

First, edit the variables defined in `defaults/main.yml` as necessary.

Then, copy the necessary `templates/hubot_?.env.j2` to
`templates/_hubot_?.env.j2` where *?* is your hubot_adapter value, and update
as necessary with the particular environment variables you need
for your Hubot instance.

Copy `hosts.example` to `hosts` and edit it to update the values for your
Hubot host. Be sure to change the following values:

* `0.0.0.0`
* `ubuntu`
* `~/.ssh/hubot_id`

Finally, update the `site.yml` playbook if you plan to use it and set
`hubot_identity` to the short username of your bot.

## Example Playbook

After configuration a basic Hubot installation and activation is possible
using the included `site.yml` playbook:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
```

You can also pass variables in using the `--extra-vars` option
to the `ansible-playbook` command:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml --extra-vars "hubot_admin=penelope hubot_adapter=hipchat hubot_identity=penelope hubot_owner='Penelope <penelope@example.com>' hubot_description='A stunning mermaid bot'"
```
## Test the role

The role can be tested with ``Molecule`` (http://molecule.readthedocs.org/en/master/).

The molecule configuration can be found at the root of the role in the ``molecule.yml`` file. The role is tested against ``Ubuntu Trusty 64`` and ``Centos 7``, but platforms can be added if need be.

To setup the test environment run the following commands:
```
mkvirtualenv -p $(which python2) molecule
pip install molecule ansible
```

To test the role run ``molecule test --platform trusty64`` or ``molecule test --platform centos7``.
